# UBC Unofficial Transcript Exporter

By default, the unofficial transcript you can download from the UBC student service center is quite ugly. It has some unattractive clutter at the top that forces it to spill over into the next page. It may be trivial, but when applying for jobs or graduate school, you probably want something cleaner and more professional looking.

## Instructions

1. There's a link on [**this page**](http://crclayton.com/projects/transcript-exporter/index.html) that you should drag onto your bookmarks bar. <sup><sup>Sorry for the redirect, I can't embed bookmarklets on GitHub</sup></sup>

2. Go to your [**Grades Summary**](https://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/sscportal/servlets/SRVSSCFramework?function=SessGradeRpt) page.

3. Click the bookmark link to run!

Or if you know what you're doing, you can just paste [this JavaScript](https://github.com/crclayton/ubc-unofficial-transcript-exporter/blob/master/export-transcript.js) into your developer tools console.

## Output

The code gets rid of the extra tabs/average calculator app, spaces things out a little better, and aligns the table to the header.
